## How ?

- Fork the repository
- Create and switch to a new branch `git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]`
- Do the changes (i.e. edit files)
- Push remote branch to your github `git remote add -t [name_of_your_remote]` & `git push -u [name_of_your_remote] [name_of_your_new_branch]`
- Create a new pull request (to my `master` branch)

Want a direct push access? No problem, just let me know and become a :family:.
